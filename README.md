# Binary Digit Classifier (0 vs 1)

This project implements a simple neural network from scratch in NumPy to classify handwritten digits '0' and '1' from the scikit-learn digits dataset.

## Highlights
- Implemented forward and backward pass manually (no libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Uses Sigmoid activation in all layers
- Final accuracy: ~ 51.39% on small binary dataset
- Visualizes predictions on test images

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells one-by-one.
3. You'll see:
   - Training logs
   - Final accuracy
   - 16 digit predictions in image format

## Dataset
We use a filtered subset of the sklearn digits dataset containing only digits `0` and `1`.
