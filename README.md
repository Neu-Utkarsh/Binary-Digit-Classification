# Classification Projects

This repo contains beginner-friendly classification projects using ML and DL.

## Projects

- **Cats vs Dogs (Binary Classification)**  
  Image classification using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and CNN.  
  Includes training vs validation plots and improvement suggestions.  
  **Note**: For model comparison, 2K images were used. Final CNN was trained on full 25K images.

- **Binary Digit Classifier (Binary Classification)**  
  A logistic regression model to classify two handwritten digits (e.g., 0 vs 1).

- **Rock-Paper-Scissors Classifier (Multiclass Classification)**  
  A CNN model trained to classify hand gestures into Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  
  Demonstrates basic multiclass classification using image data.
